# Sudoku Solver with SFML

## Overview

This C++ Sudoku solver application utilizes the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The graphical user interface is built using the SFML library, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience. The application includes various features, such as a score table, difficulty selection, pointer selection, and more.

## Features

### 1. Backtracking Algorithm

The application employs the backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. This algorithm systematically explores possible solutions and efficiently backtracks when necessary, ensuring an optimal solving process.

### 2. SFML Visualization

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is used to create a graphical user interface for the Sudoku solver. The visual representation enhances the user experience and provides a dynamic way to interact with the Sudoku puzzles.

### 3. Score Table

Keep track of your solving performance with the built-in score table. Monitor your progress and strive for faster solving times or higher accuracy.

### 4. Difficulty Selection

Choose from a range of difficulty levels to challenge yourself. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Sudoku enthusiast, the application adapts to your skill level.

### 5. Pointer Selection

The application offers multiple pointer selection options for ease of use. Whether you prefer a mouse, touchpad, or keyboard, the Sudoku solver provides a seamless interface for a variety of input devices.
